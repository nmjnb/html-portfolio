<h2>A short presentation</h2>
<p>I have many years of experience in IT and Information Security and was educated 
as an IT Security Architect. I am a certified CISA.

<br/>
<br/><strong>My specialty areas are: </strong>
<ul>
    <li>Information Security, ISO 27000</li>
    <li>Risk Management and Risk Analysis</li>
    <li>IT Audits and Compliance</li>   
</ul>

My background as a Security Analyst helped me develop much needed IT Security skills. 
My main focus the last 7 years or so has been Information Security, 
in which I've done several projects in ISO 27000. I've also worked with risk analysis 
and have experience working with GDPR. My latest journey involves web development that I'm 
learning through various projects, and I am excited to showcase my skills through this portfolio.</p>
