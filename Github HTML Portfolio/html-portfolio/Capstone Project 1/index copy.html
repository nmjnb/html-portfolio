<h1>Benjamin Eliasson</h1>
<h2>IT and Information Security Specialist</h2>
<p>I have many years of experience in IT and Information Security and was educated as an IT Security Architect. My specialty areas include Information Security and IT Audits. I am a CISA certified professional. My background as a Security Analyst has helped me develop essential IT Security skills. My main focus is Information Security, where I have worked on several projects following ISO/IEC 27000 standards. I also have experience with risk analysis and GDPR compliance.</p>

<p>I have performed multiple security analyses. In one assignment, I used the security requirements from agreements, mapped to ISO/IEC 27000, to perform a GAP analysis based on the current and target situation. I was also responsible for assessing delivery risks and implementing mitigating actions.</p>

<p>In another assignment, I conducted risk and vulnerability analyses prior to the implementation of the cloud service Office 365. The goal was to determine whether it was feasible to introduce Office 365 into the customer's business while meeting operational and security requirements.</p>

<p>I am recognized for my problem-solving abilities, cooperate well with colleagues, and enjoy finding effective solutions to security challenges. I am a team player and share my knowledge and experience freely.</p>
